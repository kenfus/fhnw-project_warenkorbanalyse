# Market basket analysis

Internal Project of the Data Science study course at FHNW.

Data used is the [instacart market basket data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis).

# Task definition:

A young entrepreneur has just taken over a retail chain with several branches. She already has some innovations in mind such as

a. a strengthening and promotion of the organic division

b. a customer-friendly arrangement of the products, so that customers can find articles more easily and reach their destination faster when shopping (store layout design)

c. an analysis of shop opening hours and a review of staff schedules, taking into account the needs of customers and employees

The entrepreneur commissions you as data scientists with data analyses to shed light on these topics. For this purpose you will receive a comprehensive data extract with information on the time and sequence of purchase transactions and product purchases for individual customers in the past months.

You agree with your client

(i) to be able to provide information on the progress of the project at any time

ii) to present the final results in a presentation

(iii) to deliver analyses and codes structured and documented as RStudio notebooks; and

(iv) to prepare a proposal for further action. 

Its analytical mission is to examine the issues of the entrepreneur. This includes, for example, first checking the quality of the data, the distribution of individual data attributes (e.g., purchase times), characterizing the clientele (e.g., one-time customers vs. regular customers), analyzing rare and frequent sales of single and combined products, and quantifying and visualizing the whole appropriately.
